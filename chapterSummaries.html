					<li data-theme="d">She did not actively look for him by going to Mademoiselle Reisz's or go to Madame Lebrun's.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">One night she goes for a drive with Alcee. When they return home it is said that "he had detected the latent sensuality" which he unfolded through his "sense" of her "requirements."</li>
					<li data-theme="d">That night she was not miserable, but she did not awaken with hope.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Edna and Robert happen to meet at cafe. Robert is surprised and "ill at ease" to see her.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Edna is straightforward about her disappointment that Robert has not visited her. She says he is selfish and does not consider her feelings.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He calls her cruel just for the sake of being cruel. Edna turns the talk to light conversation.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">They go back to Edna's house and she kisses Robert and they profess their love for each other.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Robert tells Edna the reason he went to Mexico was because he loved her but couldn't have her. He tells her that he constantly thought of her and wants her to be his wife, and is upset with himself for thinking such a thing.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Edna tells him she is not one of Leonce's possessions and could "give [her]self wherever [she] choose."</li>
					<li data-theme="c">A servant comes in and tells Edna Adele is in labor and wants her there. She tells Robert that she loves "no one but [him], and to stay and she will be back.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Adele is stressed and impatient with Dr. Mandelet's lateness.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Edna begins to remember the pain of her own childbirth, considering it torture. She now hates the "ways of Nature."</li>
					<li data-theme="d">As Edna leaves Adele whispers to her to remember and think of her children.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Dr. Mandelet walks Edna home. He says Adele should have had an "unimpressionable" woman there instead of Edna.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When asked about the summer trip Edna responds by saying she isn't going and that she will not be forced into anything.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The doctor tells Edna that she seems to be in trouble and that she can talk to him in confidence. She declines, saying she does not feel the need to talk about it. She says she just wants her "own way," even if she has to upset others for it.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The doctor tells her to come talk to him and says goodnight.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Edna sat on the porch and thinks about the night's events and Adele's parting words. She decides to go in to Robert and to think of her kids tomorrow.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Robert had left, leaving a note saying "I love you. Good-by--because I love you."</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She laid down on the sofa and stayed awake all night, never making a sound.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Edna goes to Grand Isle alone to rest.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She runs into Victor Lebrun and Mariequita, who are shocked to see her. They make plans to eat lunch and Edna tells them she wishes to go for a swim beforehand, even though they warn her the water is too cold.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She walks to the beach thinking of Robert and how she didn't want to be near anyone else. Then she thinks of her children and how she feels they have enslaved her soul.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She takes off her bathing suit and stands naked before the sea. She feels like a "new-born creature."</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She swims out without worrying about going too far out. She grows exhausted.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She thinks of her family and how they think they own her, of Mademoiselle Reisz saying an artist must possess a "should that dares and defies," of Robert who would never understand her, and finally of Doctor Mandelet who "would have understood if she had seen him--but it was too late." Her strength completely fails and she thinks of her father and sister and drowns</li>
