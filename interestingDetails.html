					<li data-theme="d">Chopin's novel has been seen as a pioneering piece of literature in the feminist movement, 
					as it featured a woman protagonist that did not need to be bound to a man to be successful and happy.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="c">Early on the novel was censored in its publication due to the detail in which she discussed 
					females sexuality, as well as having a female protagonist so far different than a typical female for that time period.
					Over time as the feminist movement gained traction, the novel was left uncensored and viewed as a wonderful work of literature.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="d">The Awakening was somewhat of a one-hit wonder for Chopin, as her writing career would go on 
					with very little success since the publishing of The Awakening, however this novel alone was enough to cement her 
					as someone who took charge in the feminist movement.</li>
